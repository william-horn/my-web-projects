@changelog-record:#change[1.0]
    [1.0]-"removed header-text-container class"
        *   this class and it's corresponding <div> in the html have been removed after being deemed unnecessary. it's initial
            purpose was to contain the <h1> tag and act as a background so that the <h1> background could remain invisible, so
            that only the <h1> borders would be visible.


@changelog-record:#change[2.0]
    [2.0]-"disabled header properties"
        *   header properties were no longer needed after setting the header text relative to viewport width (vw), and the main 
            header banner to a constant height (px). the background of the header text is now set by changing the background-color
            of the <h1>

@changelog-record:#change[3.0]-hidden
    [3.0]-"general code cleanup"
        *   sectioned all relevant css code together by separating with comments and whitespace
